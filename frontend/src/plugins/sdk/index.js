/**
 * ServerKit Plugin SDK
 *
 * Re-exports the core building blocks plugins need so they don't have to
 * reach into deep host paths. Plugins should import from this entry only:
 *
 *     import { api, useToast, Button } from '../../sdk';
 *
 * If we ever rename or restructure the host, plugins keep working as
 * long as the SDK surface stays stable.
 *
 * What a plugin's frontend can ship:
 *
 *   index.js / index.jsx           — main module, exports named React
 *                                    components matched by `component`
 *                                    references in the manifest's
 *                                    `contributions` block.
 *   plugin.json                    — copy of the manifest, written by the
 *                                    backend installer; included so Vite
 *                                    can read static metadata at build
 *                                    time if a plugin wants to.
 *   styles/*.scss|css|less         — auto-discovered and listed in
 *                                    plugins-manifest.json.
 *
 * The host fetches /api/v1/plugins/contributions at runtime; each
 * contribution's `component` field is matched against the named exports
 * of this plugin's index module. A contribution with no matching export
 * is skipped (and logged in dev).

// The SDK compatibility contract. Bump this (semver) whenever the exported
// surface below changes in a way extensions can observe:
//   MAJOR — a removed/renamed export or a breaking signature change.
//   MINOR — a new export added (older extensions keep working).
//   PATCH — a non-surface fix.
// Extensions pin a compatible range in plugin.json (`sdk_version`, e.g. "^1.0.0"),
// checked at install (manifest lint) and reported at runtime via
// GET /api/v1/plugins/contributions. The backend mirror lives in
// backend/app/utils/sdk.py — keep the two in lock-step (asserted by
// backend/tests/test_sdk_contract.py).

export { api, default as defaultApi } from '../../services/api';

// Design-system primitives — the sanctioned building blocks for plugin pages.
// A plugin page should look like a core page: PageTopbar + KpiBand +
// DataTable/ResourceList. Extensions previously deep-imported '@/components/ds'
// (still works, same modules); this is the blessed surface (Plan 20 Decision 4).

// Scheduling — extensions schedule things (cert windows, report runs, cleanup
// jobs) with the same friendly cron picker as core (Presets/Builder/Advanced +
// server-side preview). Props: value, onChange(cronString), presets?, compact?.
export { default as SchedulePicker } from '../../components/SchedulePicker';

// Common UI primitives plugins are likely to want. Re-exports kept thin
// on purpose — plugins can still reach for niche components directly,
// but the everyday surface lives here.

// AI assistant — plugins consume the core assistant rather than building their
// own chat UI. `useServerkitAI()` exposes:
//   open() / close() / toggle() / isOpen
//   ask(prompt, { context?, mode?: 'assistant'|'simple', open?=true })
//   mode / setMode(mode)
//   registerContextProvider(routePattern, () => contextObj) -> unregister
//   registerToolRenderer(toolName, Component) -> unregister
//   isStreaming / providerConfigured
//
// Plugins can also declare contributions.ai = { suggested_prompts: [{route,label,prompt}],
// tool_renderers: [{tool, component}] } in plugin.json.
